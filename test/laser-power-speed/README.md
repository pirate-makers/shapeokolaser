# Laser Power and Speed Test

This folder contains the gcode test file and the resulting images.

The test was done using a 10W+ Endurance Laser. You can find it at [endurancelasers.com](https://endurancelasers.com/diode-lasers/10watt-endurance-laser-plus/).

The laser was using the long-distance lense (not the G2), and was barely focused. I don't have a good procedure to focus right now, and the laser is already giving me lots of power. 

## Disclamer

I bought this laser myself with my own money. This test was created in Autodesk Fusion360â„¢ and exported using the post processor found in this repository. The Gcode was then duplucated and offseted using a `G92` code (by hand).

## Results

### Cherry

The test was run on a Cherry wood (Merisier) about 3/4 inch thick. The last column on the right (100% laser power) was made a 200% speed... and it's still deeply carving into the wood.

On cherry, which is my favorit hard wood, I would recommend using 10% at 600 mm/min or 20% at 1000 mm/min. Most of the other tests are really carving into the wood, as you can see on the other pictures :

I will try to light sand and see. I'll comment later here.

I also note that the left and right end of each box is a little darker... My thinking is that the power-off Gcode that happen after every line is too slow and burn more before it moves to another position.

I will try to re-enable the lead-in/lead-out and stop turning the laser off. We'll see...

Also, the test file is a parallel motion from left to right. Maybe a 45 degree motion (like I usually see from people engraving pictures) would be better. Another test to do :)

### Pine

I bearly tested on pine, and anything more than 20% laser power will carve the wood. I'll re-test and add pictures soon

### Plywood
