Laser Post-processor and stuffs for ShapeOKO and Autodesk Fusion360 

## Carbide 3D (ShapeOKO) Laser Post Processor

put the file from `posts/carbide3d-laser.cps` to your `Posts` folder. On OSX it is located at `Autodesk/Fusion 360 CAM/Posts`.

You can also import it to your Cloud Posts, and I recommend that.

Note that this Post Processor **DOES NOT** output Z axis movements. Put your laser to the right height and that's it.

### Warning / Disclamer

Feel free to use/test at your own risk. We will not feel responsible for any hurt, death, fire, tool or material destruction resulting of the use of these files.
Do it at your own risk. Better, don't use it if you don't feel comfortable. 

**Alway use the protection equipments that is required, like laser googles**

This Fusion360â„¢ post is experimental and haven't been tested for production use. Please, test it on a scrap piece and *PUT YOUR EYEWEAR PROTECTION ON* !!
It may change at any time, depeding on the results of you tests and your comments.

Please feel free to open an Issue if you have any comment.

### Usage
I have two workflows for now : 

#### Laser cutting (tracing)
I use a 0.1mm Kerf width `Laser Cutter` that I created in my tool list:

![Laser Cutter Tool](pictures/laser-tool.png?raw=true "Laser Cutter Tool")

On your design, just create a sketch with all your curves, or import an SVG file.

In the CAM (Manufacrture) section of Fusion360, create a new `Setup` and define your stock size and origin. Keep the `Operation type` to the default, `Milling`
Then click on the `Fabrication` menu above the icons, then select `Cutting` -> `2D profile`.
This will add a cutting toolpath.

Select your 0.1mm laser as the tool and select the cutting mode. `Through` and `Vaporise` both use a 100% laser beam, while `Etch` is less powerfull. You can change the power output in the *Post-Process* phase.
Also select your `Cutting Feedrate` (600mm/min per default). This is the speed of the movement.

Select the curves you want to trace in the `Geometry` tab.

In the `Heights`, select a 0 (zero) offset fron `Stock top` for Clearance, Retract and Top:

![2D Profile Heights](pictures/2d-profile.png?raw=true "2D Profile Heights")

In `Passes`, select a 0.01mm tolerance, left compensation and `in computer` compensation type.

In the final tab, `Linking`, ensure nothing is checked. Lead-in and Lead-out should NOT be selected.

I had to create many `2d Profiles` on my project so everything renders nicely. This is not uncommon when using SVG. If you fell the `Generate` phase of your toolpath never ends, it may be a good option to select only few curves, then add more, or create another `2d profiles` for another section of your curves.

When calculating you will end up with a yellow warning, like 

```text
Warning: Lifting retract plane to topmost lead height.
Warning: Lifting clearance plane to retract plane.
```

This can be ignored.

Finally click on your `2d profiles` or the `Setup` you want to trace with your laser and select `Post Process`.

Select the `Laser Carbide 3D(Grbl)` post processor from you Cloud Posts or Personnal Posts.
You should not have to change any value here except the `Through Power` if you want to change the laser power:

![Post Process](pictures/post-process.png?raw=true "Post Process")

You will end up with a Gcode (nc) file that you can import in your controler software. I personnally use [CNCJS](https://cnc.js.org/).

##### Example
![Tree Of Life](pictures/treeOfLife.png?raw=true "Tree Of Life")

#### Laser burning
This workflow is used when you want to create a black and white image, logo...

In the `Design` part of Fusion360, create a slight extrusion of your design. This is not mandatory but usually help the pre-processor. As the `post generator` does not handle Z-axis, it should not be an issue.

Create a `3D -> Parallel` tool path. Select your 0.1 or 0.2mm tool. Set the `Spindle Speed` to the laser power you want (ex : 255 = full power if your CNC is set with $30=255). Also set your `Cutting Feedrate` to the speed you want.
Select your shape in the `Geometry` tab. In the `Passes` tab, change the stepover. I usually make it a little less than the laser width (the tool you created). For example, if I use the 0.2mm tool, I will set the stepover to 0.19mm. This is a parameter you can play with depeding on your beam size.

And that's it.
Again, the post-processor do two things for you : 
 - remove the Z-axis movements (so you don't care of Z lead-ins or outs)
 - stop the laser during anything except cutting (like lead-in/out)

More examples to come.
